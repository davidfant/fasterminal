## Fasterminal

This is the result of a 48h Hackaton aimed at reimagining the Terminal app. One big problem with terminals is discovery. Using `man` or `--help` commands is just terrible UX. Unless you know exactly what you're doing, you're lost. Here is how Fasterminal tries to make this better:
* Show autocomplete suggestions for commands with more information
* Display CLI flags visually in forms to better show what's available
* Integrate with Stack Overflow to get questions answered directly in the Terminal
